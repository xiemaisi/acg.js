htmledit; version 4.0.3

Note: Analyzed all code included in demo-iconset-silk.html; extracted script elements into demo-iconset_silk_{1,2,3,4}.js.

Replication note: HTMLEdit doesn't seem to be on the website anymore. Probably it has been replaced by JQuery HtmlBox which seems to do the same thing and has the same HTML files.
